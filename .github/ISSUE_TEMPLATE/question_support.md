            fileSizeInBytes: Long,
            currentChunk: Int,
            currentChunkSizeInBytes: Long
        ) {
            // Update the UI according chunk data
        }
        override fun onSuccess(timiMillis: Long) {

            chunkCount: Int,
            chunkSize: Int
        ) {
            // Handle Chunk Upload Failure
        }
        override fun onError(error: String, timeMillis: Long) {
            // Handle error message
